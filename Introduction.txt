Speaker recognition is the process of automatically recognizing who is speaking on the basis of individual information included in speech waves. This technique makes it possible
to use the speaker's voice to verify their identity and control access to services such as voice dialing, banking by telephone, telephone shopping, database access services, 
information services, voice mail, security control for confidential information areas, and remote access to computers.This document describes how to build a simple, yet complete 
and representative automatic speaker recognition system.  Such a speaker recognition system has potential in many security applications.  For example, users have to speak a 
PIN (Personal Identification Number) in order to gain access to the laboratory door, or users have to speak their credit card number over the telephone line to verify their 
identity.  By checking the voice characteristics of the input utterance, using an automatic speaker recognition system similar to the one that we will describe, the system is 
able to add an extra level of security.
This project contains framing of signal, mel cepstral coefficients, linear prediction coefficients, lbg algorithm and finally feature matching.
Each and every part of code id explained in resepective text files. Please have a look on it.
