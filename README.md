# Speaker-Recognition
Speaker recognition is the process of automatically recognizing who is speaking on the basis of individual information included in speech waves.

### Pipeline of project:
1) Pre-processing of input audio signal
2) Feature extraction (MFCC OR LPC)
3) Feature matching with LBG
4) Training 
5) Testing 

### Mel frequency cepstral coefficients
Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are coefficients that collectively make up an MFC. The difference between the cepstrum and the mel-frequency cepstrum is that in the MFC, the frequency bands are equally spaced on the mel scale, which approximates the human auditory system's response. We have choosen Mfccs for feature extraction because they shows more significant variation from speaker to speaker since they are derived on logarithmic scale.
### Linear prediction coefficients
LPCs are another popular feature for speaker recognition. To understand LPCs, we must first understand the Autoregressive model of speech. Speech can be modelled as a pth order AR process.These coefficeients give characteristics of input audio signal.
### LBG(Linde-Buzo-Gray)algorithm
Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) Algorithm is used for designing of Codebook efficiently which has minimum distortion and error.It is an iterative procedure and the basic idea is to divide the group of training vectors and use it to find the most representative vector from one group. These representative vectors from each group are gathered to form the codebook. Since codebook derived from LBG shows min distortion we have choosen this.


### Training and Testing
Model is trained over data sets (finding codebooks).  
Feed the model with testing data sets and find out which speakers from training data sets are matching with testing data sets respectively. 

### Results
Accuracy for model is 100 % for both mfccs and lpcs on 8 speakers data set.
### Note
Model show errors for a audio signal containing a silent part.
